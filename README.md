# Functional Programming in scala

Step-by-step guide for FP in Scala

## Installation

I. First [Download Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

Choose the IntelliJ IDEA route

II. Then [Download IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

III. Now follow the "Installation" steps [here](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/intellij-track/getting-started-with-scala-in-intellij.html)

IV. In IntelliJ -> (File) -> Preferences -> Plugins you should have the Scala plugin installed.
Otherwise do that. You should restart IntelliJ afterwards

Va. Optionally fork this repo

V. Next: File -> New -> Project from Version control

This should clone this (or the forked) repo locally and detect the `build.sbt` file and automatically install all the correct dependencies

Troubleshooting:

If IntelliJ doesn't detect it's a Scala project you might optionally have to check the Scala download under File -> New Project

Sometimes deleting the project, restarting IntelliJ and recloning (V.) the project fixes things
